Multifunctional Medical Image Intelligent Processing and Analysis System for Precision Orthodontics is a system based on medical images in various formats. It leverages modern computer software's computational and storage capabilities, integrating knowledge and experience from orthodontics for diagnosing and analyzing dental issues. As society progresses, peopleâ€™s focus on dental health has increasingly grown. The system's data analysis module, combined with the results from the image intelligent algorithm module and the user-marked data in the visualization module, is used for distance measurement or angle measurement. Specifically, it includes common orthodontic measurements, such as tooth width, arch length, arch width, and Spee curve measurements. Based on these measurements, orthodontic analysis and diagnosis are carried out, providing analysis reports that include common assessments like cephalometric analysis, dental crowding evaluation, midline relationship evaluation, and Bolton Index analysis. The report reflects the user's data annotations, measurements, and analysis results.

The key technologies used in the project include Qt application development, Python deep learning algorithm design, C++ graphical rendering interaction, and SQL databases.

Oral diseases are closely related to human health beyond just aesthetic factors. Currently, the prevalence rate of oral diseases in China exceeds 90%, while the treatment rate is only about 10%, severely impacting public health. A digital dental medical image processing and analysis system can improve the diagnostic accuracy and work efficiency of orthodontists, significantly enhancing the digitalization of orthodontics. The system is divided into four modules: data management, image intelligent algorithm, visualization, and data analysis.

Data Management Module: The core function of this module is data operations. It includes standardized DICOM medical image format storage and management, data migration backup, desensitization export operations, and providing standardized data operation APIs.

Image Intelligent Algorithm Module: This module includes mainstream medical image segmentation and key point detection algorithms. Specifically, it includes:

Automatic dental segmentation algorithm for 2D X-ray images,
2D cephalometric landmark detection algorithm,
Cephalometric and patient side-view photo fusion algorithm based on key point matching,
3D CBCT dental and alveolar bone segmentation algorithm. This module achieves automatic or semi-automatic segmentation in medical images based on algorithms and supports recommending applicable segmentation algorithms based on the image type. For X-ray and CBCT image data, compared to manual segmentation, it supports using methods like region growing, region splitting and merging, and watershed algorithms for fast organ or element segmentation and classification.
Visualization Module: This module supports 2D and 3D image visualization and interactive operations. For 2D images, it supports interactive functions like marking and measurement, along with common image processing operations such as brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and cropping. It also stores the marks and image copies persistently. For 3D images, it supports three-view display and 3D rendering, using Ray-Casting direct volume rendering and Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) techniques for image rendering. It supports multiple color mappings, preset thresholds, and ROI operations, and allows for spatial interaction to locate and map the rendered images back to the original. For results from the image intelligent algorithm module, they need to be overlaid onto the original image for visualization, and pixel-level segmentation and classification result modifications are supported. The module can use Marching Cubes or other algorithms for 3D mesh reconstruction of CBCT segmentation results.
